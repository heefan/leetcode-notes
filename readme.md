# My Leetcode Learning Notes

### 4 Levels
1. Fix most easy and few medium questions within 30 min or more.  (beginner)
2. Fix most easy/medium questions within 10 min or more. (medium)
3. Fix most easy/medium questions within 5 min or less. (advanced)
4. Fix most easy/medium/hard questions within 5 min or less. (most advanced)

### Learning
I have been doing the leetcode for 6 months.      
I tried to do the questions by sequence and by topic.     
I tried a few weekly contests.
It seems not efficient to me.

#### Steps:
1. Target for patterns
    * understand all the algorithms
    * remember the code the patterns
    * Around 150 questions.
    * Require you to complete any prototype questions within 5 min.
2. Practice medium questions to expand your perspective.
    * In the stage, the purpose is to know more ideas.
3. Contest
    * Join the contest to gain more confidence.


### Prepare for An Interview
1. dry run your solution, and point out the key points
2. indicate the time complexity and space complexity
3. Confirm with the interviewer.
4. Code it.
    * if prototype question, require to complete within 5 min
    * if medium+ questions, require to complete within 10 min
    * if hard questions, you should be able to analyze them.
