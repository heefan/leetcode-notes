```cpp
l = -1,
r = N,
while l+1 != r 
    m = l + (r-l)/2
    if IsBlue(m)         
        l = m
    else                
        r = m

return l or r                
```

### Question 1: why not init `l=0, r=N-1`? 
![](../../../images/1.png)
No, you cannot init l as 0, and r as N-1. 
In the implementation, if l start from 0, meaning all the numbers are in red area
Similar, if r=N-1, meaning, all the area is blue.

### Question 2: Can I wirte `l=m+1` or `m=r-1`?
No. Consider about the correctness and understandability. 
In the algorithm, we keep blue and red area, don't let it cross.
